( White square rules )
( it is open space for both characters )
( both can enter it at the same time by freely moving onto it )
( blocks can be pushed onto it but the white is gone forever )
( if a block is pushed onto it while the other character is there, they are in the block )
( targets in the white? both targets on the same square? if pushing a block onto a target the white is destroyed but target remains)
