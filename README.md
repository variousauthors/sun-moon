This is a little puzzlescript.

### Contributing ###

In order to edit and test the game, you will need to open the [puzzlescript editor][0] in a browser,
and then copy/paste the contents of `rules.pz` and `world.pz` into that editor. The use of
`.pz` in the file names is purely a convention, meant to distinguish the puzzlescript files
from any other files that might end up in here.

When you are done editing the puzzlescript, make sure to copy/paste the entire game from
the puzzlescript editor back into these two files. `world.pz` should always contain only
the ascii maps. This is for ease of editing in VI later on (where I can do block copy,
instead of having to do line by line copy).
