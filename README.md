This is a little puzzlescript.

### Contributing ###

In order to edit/test the game, you will need to open the [puzzlescript editor][0] in a browser,
and then copy paste the contents of `rules.pz` and `world.pz` into that editor. The use of
`.pz` in the file names is purely a convention, meant to distinguish the puzzlescript files
from any other files that might end up in here.
